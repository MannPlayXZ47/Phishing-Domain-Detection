# 🛡️ Phishing Domain Detection

This project is a machine learning-based web application that detects phishing domains using associative classification and feature engineering from URLs. It provides a simple interface to check if a given URL is **safe** or **phishing**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Accepts user-submitted URLs for prediction
- 🧠 Uses a trained Random Forest classifier
- 🔗 Extracts detailed URL features (IP count, redirect history, SSL certs, etc.)
- 🧰 Flask-based web interface for easy access
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight—no database or logging required in the lightweight version
